Desura Linux - README
Website: http://www.desura.com

Installation:
	Extract the 'desura' binary to any location where your user has write
	permissions, and run. It will download the rest of the components required
	and install itself into a folder called 'desura', unless it's already in one.

Uninstallation:
	Delete 'desura' folder the contains the program contents. To remove the menu
	icon, first run "xdg/xdg-desktop-menu uninstall --mode user desura.desktop"
	from inside the Desura installation directory (without quotes).
	
Reset installation:
	Simply delete the 'settings', 'cache' and 'common' folders to reset Desura
	to its original state. Also deleting the desura_appfiles.xml force Desura
	to reinstall itself.

Updating:
	If for any reason Desura will not update itself, or you can not get to a
	point where it would update itself (eg: can't login), running "./desura -f"
	from the installation directory (without quotes)will force it to download
	the latest available update and restart.

Contributing:
	Any and all help is welcomed. We are constantly looking for ways to improve
	the service we provide, and all feedback is helpful.
	
	When testing Desura and reporting bugs, including console output is always
	useful. Even better, running Desura with gdb and providing the output
	and a 'backtrace' helps us greatly.
